# pclass          Passenger Class
#                 (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)
# name            Name
# sex             Sex
# age             Age

# 
# SPECIAL NOTES:
# Pclass is a proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
#  1st ~ Upper; 2nd ~ Middle; 3rd ~ Lower
# 
# Age is in Years; Fractional if Age less than One (1)
#  If the Age is Estimated, it is in the form xx.5
# 
# With respect to the family relation variables (i.e. sibsp and parch)
# some relations were ignored.  The following are the definitions used
# for sibsp and parch.
# 
# Sibling:  Brother, Sister, Stepbrother, or Stepsister of Passenger Aboard Titanic
# Spouse:   Husband or Wife of Passenger Aboard Titanic (Mistresses and Fiances Ignored)
# Parent:   Mother or Father of Passenger Aboard Titanic
# Child:    Son, Daughter, Stepson, or Stepdaughter of Passenger Aboard Titanic
# 
# Other family relatives excluded from this study include cousins,
# nephews/nieces, aunts/uncles, and in-laws.  Some children travelled
# only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.  As well, some
# travelled with very close friends or neighbors in a village, however,
# the definitions do not support such relations.
